This repository provides the official implementation of our paper:

> **DA-CFBC: Direction-Aware and Center-Focused Boundary-Constrained Framework for CBCT**  
> _Bin Wang, et al._  


We propose a novel 3D deep learning framework for **tooth instance segmentation** in Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images. Our model introduces a direction-aware convolution module and a center-focused boundary constraint strategy to effectively address challenges like directional variation, metal artifacts, and inter-tooth adhesion.
